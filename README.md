### **Motivation for the project:**

#### I wanted to create something that will be used in the future (by my partner who is a psychologist)

</br>

### **A project with full of challenges:**

- scroll down on the page on button click
- navigation on the website
- creating a calendar through api
- disable buttons in real time (if time passes)
- disable buttons if data is sent
- connecting form to google forms and sending e-mail
- creating an admin login page (jwt, cookies, routes)
- learning and using backend
- the project is built alone without a team (with mentor help)

### **Working on this project helped me to improve a lot in soft skills:**

- time management
- problem solving
- not giving up when being stuck for a long time
- not being afraid to ask for help
- enjoying learning about new technologies

### **And hard skills too:**

- api calls with axios
- backend using express
- saving data in local storage or cookies
- email sending from form
- react states, effect hook, react context
- navigation on the website with react router
- learning about registration, signing in and protected routes
